# Welcome
The purpose of this repository is to control Per-Key RGB Keyboard on an MSI Laptop running macOS using a native app. This is the wrapper of [SSKeyboard](https://github.com/ErrorErrorError/SSKeyboard), which is the brains of communicating with the keyboard.
<br>
<br> 
This app is still in development.

# Goal
The goal is to support all MSI Laptop keyboards that have RGB.
# Supported Models 
*   MSI GS65
*   MSI GE63 Raider RGB

### Supported Modes: PerKey
*   Steady
*   More coming soon...
# Build
Run on terminal:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ErrorErrorError/SSKeyboardHue.git
```
Make sure you use ```.xcworkspace``` file if you're planning to run the app from xcode.
